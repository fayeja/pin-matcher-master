# Pin_matcher_master
Pin-Matcher-Master is a JavaScript-based project designed to create a secure and user-friendly PIN verification system. The primary goal of this project is to generate a random PIN and provide a mechanism for users to input a PIN for verification. If the entered PIN matches the generated one, the system displays a success message; otherwise, it indicates a failed attempt.
